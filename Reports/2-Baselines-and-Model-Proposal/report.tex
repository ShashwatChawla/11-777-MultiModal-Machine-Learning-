\maketitle

\section{Baseline Models and Metrics (2 pages)}
Please explain the baselines you are using. This includes (but is not limited to):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Unimodal baselines
  \item Very simple multimodal models  
  \item Alternate choices for modules (e.g. encoders/decoders)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Unimodal Baselines}
We include the following unimodal baselines: ... we expect these to capture ...

\subsection{Simple Multimodal Baselines}
We include a very simple multimodal baseline that ... ignores history... doesn't have attention ... doesn't require pretraining ....

\subsection{Competitive Baselines}
We run $N$ competitive baselines available at public repos.  These include: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item System 1 is a ... whose key insight is ... 
  \item System 2 is a ... whose key insight is ... 
  \item System 3 is a ... whose key insight is ... 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results (1 page)}
Replace columns with the correct metrics for your task (extrinsic). What are 
all the things you can measure, and why are they beneficial?
\paragraph{Metric 1}

\paragraph{Metric 2}

\paragraph{Metric 3}


\clearpage
\section{Model Proposal (1 page)}
Include a diagram (e.g. labeled flow chart) of all modules.  This is not final!

\subsection{Overall model structure}

\subsection{Encoders}
Describe encoders for each modality and at least one alternatives for each.  Explain the relative strengths of each option (e.g. coverage, efficiency, ...)

\subsection{Decoders}

\subsection{Loss Functions}
Describe both your primary task loss and three possible auxiliary losses that might improve performance.  Justify your choices.
