\maketitle

\section{Analysis (4 pages)}
This section should include plots.  For example, how key metrics vary with a specific hyperparameter, task complexity, etc.

\subsection{Intrinsic Metrics}
These are not the task itself (they might overlap with auxiliary losses) but are skills the model should have.

\paragraph{Intrinsic Metric 1}
\paragraph{Intrinsic Metric 2}
\paragraph{Intrinsic Metric 3}

% Update this table with your extrinsic and intrinsic metrics.  
% Update rows with what you ran
% How well did they do on every metric?

\clearpage
\subsection{Qualitative Analysis and Examples (full page table)}
A full page table that includes: Example input, comparison of model outputs, theory about reason for failure. Every model presented should have at least one failure condition

\paragraph{Insights}
Two paragraphs on what you found and how they impact your expectations for the main model, or how they have inspired you to change your proposed approach, etc
