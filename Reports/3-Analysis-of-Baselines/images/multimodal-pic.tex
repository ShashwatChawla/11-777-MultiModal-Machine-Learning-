    Effectiveness of visual-LiDAR fusion for better estimation of dense depth map. Each row contains one example of the improvement in RGB image frame, DepthNet estimation, fusion result, respectively. Top row: attachments to the roof of the vehicle exist in the fused map where DepthNet is not able to estimate it. Bottom row: Vehicle boundaries are more noticeable and DepthNet is fooled due to graphics at the side hood of the van.
