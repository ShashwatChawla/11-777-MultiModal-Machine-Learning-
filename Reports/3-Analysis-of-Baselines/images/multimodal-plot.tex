\caption{
    Translation errors averaged across sub-sequences of various lengths (100, 200, ..., 800 meters) within sequences 09 and 10 of the KITTI dataset. The performance results for the LiDAR-only method (red lines), camera-only method (blue lines), and LiDAR-camera fusion method (green lines) are displayed.
